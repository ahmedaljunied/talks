### Launchpad for impact
Things you need to know to have significant impact

The idea here is that, to have impact, you need to be able to build things that can grow. Your codebase has to be extensible and flexible enough, within reason of course.

If that is not the case, you will keep running into 2 things:

1) scaling issues with even small amounts of growth
2) inability to accomodate feature requests, even simple ones

I propose a list of skills that I feel are necessary

1) CS Foundation
2) Object oriented basics, concepts and principles
3) Basic software architecture
4) Basic system architecture
5) Tests

### CS Foundation

As a product engineer, knowing how things work is beneficial. Specifically the things we depend on. Knowing the performance and limits of your machines, being aware of the myths of [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing) and the uses of different database systems will give you additional contexts when designing systems and writing code.

Storage - mem, disk
CPU - processes, threads
Network - roundtrip, latencies, discovery, protocols, routing
Databases - ACID, transactions, indexes,

### Object oriented design

This is probably still the most accessible and scalable paradigm for application design with many well thought out concepts to give engineers a good set of tools to design significant applications.

These basics are non-negotiable. Learn fundamentals then frameworks.

1) OO Basics: class, object
2) OO Concepts: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance [Read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
3) OO Principles: [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [READ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#SOLID_and_GRASP_guidelines)
4) OO Patterns: [Read](http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/gofpatterns.aspx)
